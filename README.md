### Feature Engineering
1. **Review Helpfulness Features:**
   - `total_reviews`: Extracted from `review/helpfulness` (e.g., "2/3" ‚Üí 3)
   - `helpful_reviews`: Extracted from `review/helpfulness` (e.g., "2/3" ‚Üí 2)
   - `percentage_helpful`: Calculated ratio (helpful_reviews / total_reviews)

2. **Sentiment Analysis Features:**
   - `review_summary_sentiment_score`: Sentiment score for review summaries
   - `review_text_sentiment_score`: Sentiment score for full review text
